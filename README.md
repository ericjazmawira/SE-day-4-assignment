## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
        Agile is a flexible method where work is done in small parts and improved continuously

        Waterfall is a step-by-step method where each stage is finished before moving to the next.

        Agile is an iterative and flexible approach, while Waterfall follows a sequential and structured process.
        Agile consists of continuous cycles (sprints), whereas Waterfall moves through linear phases from requirements to deployment. 
        Agile is highly adaptable to changes, while Waterfall is rigid and costly to modify. 
        Agile requires frequent customer involvement, whereas Waterfall gathers feedback mainly at the end. 
        Agile delivers incremental updates, while Waterfall provides the complete product at the end. 
        Agile incorporates ongoing testing, whereas Waterfall conducts testing after development. 
        Agile prioritizes minimal documentation, while Waterfall relies on extensive documentation. 
        Agile is best for dynamic projects, whereas Waterfall suits well-defined, stable projects.

        ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
        1. Agile is flexible, allowing quick adaptations, but it has less predictable costs and timeliness while
        waterfall is detailed making it easier to estimate costs and time but it is inflexible to changes.
        2. Agile enables early delivery of working features, but it requires constant client involvement while 
        waterfall ensures thorough planning, but late testing may reveal critical issues
        2. Agile is ideal for fast-moving projects, but it can be challenging for large teams while Waterfall provides stability, but user feedback comes too late to make major adjustments.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
        Agile is ideal for projects requiring flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative development 
            e.g. Software Development Startups like e-commerce
                 AI & Machine Learning Projects - they require continuous improvements
                 E-commerce Platforms - frequent updates from trends and customer feedback           
        Waterfall works best for projects with clear, fixed requirements and minimal changes.
            e.g Government & Compliance Projects
                Construction & Infrastructure
                Embedded Systems & Hardware Development 

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
        Planning & Requirement Analysis – Clearly define project goals to avoid errors from the start.
        Code Reviews & Pair Programming – Team members check each other's code to improve quality.
        Automated & Manual Testing – Combine automated scripts for speed and manual tests for accuracy.
        Continuous Integration & Deployment  – Regularly merge and test updates to catch issues early.
        User Feedback & Beta Testing – Involve real users to identify usability problems.
        Bug Tracking &  Documentation – Keep detailed records of issues and solutions to maintain quality.

        Importance of Maintaining High Standards
        Prevents Costly Errors – Fixing issues early is cheaper than after release.
        Enhances User Experience – Reliable software leads to satisfied users.
        Improves Security & Performance – Reduces vulnerabilities and ensures efficiency.
        Supports Long-Term Growth – Well-maintained software is easier to update and expand.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
        Sets Clear Goals – Ensures everyone understands objectives.
        Prevents Scope Creep – Avoids unplanned changes that cause delays.
        Improves Resource Allocation – Assigns time, budget, and manpower efficiently.
        Enhances Stakeholder Communication – Aligns expectations from the start.
        Provides a Basis for Progress Tracking – Helps measure project success.
        
        A WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller, manageable tasks.

        Why is WBS Useful?
        Improves Organization – Breaks complex projects into simpler parts.
        Enhances Task Delegation – Assigns responsibilities clearly.
        Aids Time & Cost Estimation – Helps in budgeting and scheduling.
        Facilitates Risk Management – Identifies potential challenges early.

        
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
        Improved Time Management – Guarantees timely completion of tasks.
        Enhances Efficiency in Resource Distribution – Distributes staff and supplies appropriately.
        Minimized Risks & Delays – Proactively recognizes possible bottlenecks.
        Greater Level of Responsibility – Monitors results and delegates obligations.
        Improves Communication – Provides timely updates for all stakeholders.
        
        The Relationship Between Gantt Charts and Scheduling

        How Gantt Charts Assist in Scheduling
        Visual Timeline – It visually presents work breakdown structure, periods per task, and links between them.
        Task Dependencies – Establishes relationships between dependents and milestones to be achieved.
        Progress Tracking – Monitors constant progress and alerts for any disruptions encountered.
        Workload Balancing – Aids in work distribution and reorganization, if need be, within the team.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
        Improving Software Development Efficiency through coding, debugging, testing and deploying
        Bug Tracking and Error Resolution
        Code Quality and Maintainability
        Collaboration and Communication 

        These problems matter because:
